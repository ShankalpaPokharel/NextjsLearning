# NextjsLearning 

<b>React framework to build web application (production ready)</b>
It uses react for building user interfaces, providedes additional features that enable you to build produciton-ready applications. These feature include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling and more. (don't need additional packages , opinions and conventions should be follwed to implement these)

## Why learn Next.js ? 
Next.js simplifies the process of building a web application for production : 

1. Routing (don't need to install thrid party, offers file base of routing)
2. API routes
3. Rendering(support both server and client side)
4. Data fetching
5. Styling
6. Optimizing
7. Dev and prod build system(focus on coding rather than setup)


## React Server Componets (RSC)

React SErver compoents is a new architecture introduced by the React team in version 18 which was quickly embraced by Nexrt.js

The architectture introduces a new way of creating React components, splitting them in two types:
- ### Server components
    - In Next.js, all components are Server components by default. 
    - They have the ability to ruun tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.
    - However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interaction 
- ### Client Components 
    - To create a Client components, it's necessary to add ```use client``` at the top of the component file. 
    - Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions. 
    - It is traditional react components. 

## Routing

Next.js has a file-system based routing mechanism
URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase

### Routing Conventions
All routes must be placed inside the app folder
Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx
Every folder corresponds to a path segments in the browers url

## File Colocation
File colocation refers to the practice of organizing and placing files close to where they are used or relevant within the project structure.

To return content should be defalut export function without it page doen't return anythings

## Private Folder
Private folder indeicated that is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system. 

The folder and all its subfolders are excluded from routing

Prefix the folder name with an underscore

For separating UI logic from routing logic
For consistentlly organizing internal files across a project
For sorting and grouping files in code ediotrs
And finally, for avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions. 
If you want to include an undercore in URL segments, you can prefix the foder name with "%5F" which is the URL -encoded form of an underscore, if you use %5F it will become route.

## Route Groups
Allow us to logically group our routes and project files without affecting the URL path structure 

naming convention ```(group_name)```

Let's implement authentication routes
 - Register
 - Login
 - Forget password

## Layouts
A page is UI that is unique to a route

A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages in the app
___________
| Header  |
-----------
| Contet  |
-----------
| Footer  |
-----------

### How to create Layouts
You c  an define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.js or layout.tsx file 
That component should accept a children prop that will be populated with a child page rendering

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-03 at 5.06.12 PM.png>)

```tsx
export const metadata = {
    title: "Hello from Next.js",
    description: "Generated by Next.js",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>
                <header style={{backgroundColor:"lightblue",padding:"1rem"}}>
                    <p>header</p>
                </header>
                {children}
                <footer style={{backgroundColor:"ghostwhite",padding:"1rem"}}>
                    <p>Footer</p>
                </footer>
            </body>
        </html>
    );
}

```

### Nested Layout
```tsx
<!-- routing-demo/src/app/products/[productId]/layout.tsx -->

export default function ProductDetailsLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
        <>
            {children}
            <h2>Feature Products</h2>
        </>
    );
}

```

### Route Group Layout

Route Group uses:
 - To organize your project in a manner that doesn't affect URL
 - To selectively apply a layout to certain segments while leaving others unchanged

 ![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-03 at 5.34.34 PM.png>)


 ## Routing Metadata
 Ensuring proper search engin optimization(SEO) is crucial for increasing visibility and attractting users

 Next.js introduced the Metadata API which allows you to define metadata for each page

Metadata ensures accurate and relevant information is displyed when your pages are shared or indexed

### Configuring Metadata

- Export a static metadata object
- Export a dynamic generated Meatadata function

### Metadata rules
Both layout.tsx and page.tsx fiels can export metadata. If defined in a layout, it applies to all pages in that layout, but if defined in a pge, it applies only to that page. 

Metadata is read in order, from the root level down to the final page page level. 

When there's metadata in multiple places for the save route, but page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have the same properties. 

```ts
export const metadata = {
  title:"About Codevolution"
}

export default function page() {
  return (
    <div>Welcome about</div>
  )
}

```
```ts
import { Metadata } from "next";
import { resolve } from "path";

type Props = {
    params: { productId: string };
};

export const generateMetadata = async ({ params }: Props): Promise<Metadata> => {
    const title = await new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(`iPhone ${params.productId}`);
        }, 100);
    });
    return { title: `Product ${title}` };
    // return { title:`Product ${params.productId}` }
};

export default function ProductDetails({ params }: Props) {
    console.log(params);
    return <div>Details about product {params.productId}</div>;
}

```


<b> You can't export both  the metadata object and generate metadata fucntion from same route segment</b>


### title Metadata
The title field's primary purpose is to define the document title
It can be either a string or an object 

```ts

import { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata:Metadata = {
    title: {
        absolute:"",
        default:"Learning Next.js",
        template:"%s | Shankalpa"
    },
    description: "Generated by Next.js",
};

```
```ts
import { Metadata } from "next"

export const metadata:Metadata = {
  title:{
    absolute:"blog" //tille will be blog don't follow the template when use absolute
  }
}

export default function SecondBlog() {
  return (
    <div>SecondBlog Post</div>
  )
}

```



## Navigation
File based routing

We manually entered the URLKs in the browser's adress bar to navigate to the different route

User rely on UI elements like links to navigate:
 - Clicking on them or
 - Through programmatic navigation after completing an action


![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-03 at 8.23.09 PM.png>)

### Link Componet Navigation

To enable client-side navigation Next.js provides us wiht the Link component. 

The ```<Link>``` component is a React component that extends the HTML ```<a>``` element,  and it's the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js. 

To use it, we need to import it from ```next/link```

The```replace``` attribute is used to replace the current entry in the browser's history stack instead of adding a new one. This can be useful when you want to navigate without keeping the previous URL in the history.

```tsx
import Link from "next/link"

export default function page() {
  const productId = 100
  return (
    <>
    <Link href="/"> Home</Link>
    <div>Product List</div>
    <h2> <Link href="products/1">Product 1</Link></h2>
    <h2> <Link href="products/2">Product 2</Link></h2>
    <h2> <Link href="products/3" replace>Product 3</Link></h2>
    <h2> <Link href={`products/${productId}`}>Product {productId}</Link></h2>
    </>
  )
}

```

### Active Links
```jsx
"use client"
import Link from "next/link";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
import "./style.css"

const navLinks = [
    { name: "Register", href: "/register" },
    { name: "Login", href: "/login" },
    { name: "Forgot Password", href: "/forgot-password" },
];

export default function AuthLayout({ children }: {children: React.ReactNode}) {
    const pathname = usePathname()
   
    console.log(pathname)
    return (
        <div>
            {navLinks.map((link) => {
                const isActive = pathname.startsWith(link.href)
                return <Link href={link.href} key={link.name} className={isActive ? "font-bold mr-4":"text-blue-500 mr-4"}>{link.name}</Link>;
            })}
            {children}
        </div>
    );
}

```

### Navigating Pprogrammatically

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-03 at 9.07.25 PM.png>)

```tsx
"use client"
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"

export default function OrderProduct() {
    const router = useRouter()
    const handleClick = ()=>{
        console.log("Placing your order")
        router.push("/")
        // router.replace("/")
        // router.back()
        // router.forward()
    }
  return (
    <>
    <h1>Order Product</h1>
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Place order</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Templates
Templates are similar to layouts in that they wrap each child layout or page. 

But, with templates, when a user navigates between routes that share a template, a new instance of the components is mounted, DOM elements are recreated, state is not preserved , and effects are re-syncghronized. 

A template can be defined by exporting a default React component from a template.js or template.tsx file. 

Similar to layouts, templates also should accept a children props which will render the nested segments in the route. 

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 9.45.41 AM.png>)

## Special Files
 - page.tsx
 - layout.tsx
 - template.tsx
 - not-found.tsx
 - loading.tsx
 - error.tsx

### loading.tsx 
This file allows us to create loading states that are displayed to users while a specific route segments's content is loading. 

The loading state appears immediatelly upon navigation, giveing users the assurance that the application is responsive and actively loading content. 

<b>It is like React Loading Skeleton</b>

### loading.tsk Benefits
1. You can disply the loading state as soon as a user navigates to a new route 
    The immediate feedback reassures user theat their actions has been acknowledged, reduces preceived loading times, and makes the application feel more responsive. 

2. Next.js allows the creation of shared layouts that remain interactive while new route segments are loading. 

    User can continue interacting with crtain parts of the application, asuch as a navigation menu or sidebar, if the main content is still being fetched. 


### error.tsx
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 10.07.37 AM.png>)

Automatically wrap a route segment and it's nested children in a React Error Boundary

Create error UI tailored ot specific segents using the file-system hierarchy to adjust granularity

Isolate error to affected segments while keeping the rest of the application functional

Add functionality to attempt to recover from an error without a full page reload.

### Component Hierachy

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 10.10.43 AM.png>)

### Recover From Error using reset
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 10.16.38 AM.png>)


### Handling Errros in Nested Routes
Error bubble up to the closest parent error boundary

An error.tsx file will cater to errors for all its nested child segments

By positoning error.tsx files at different levels in the nested folders of a route, you can achive a more granular level of error handling. 


### Handling Errors in Layouts

An error.tsx file will handle errors for all its nested child segments

The error boundary doesn't catch error thrown here because it's nested inside the layout component.

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 10.33.44 AM.png>)


## Parallel Routes
Parallel routes are an advanced routing mechanism that allows for the simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 10.37.26 AM.png>)


    - Parallel routes in Next.js are defined using a feature known as slots
    - Slots help structure our content in a modular fashion
    - To define a slot, we use the @folder naming convention
    - Each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding 'layout.ts' file.

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 10.45.06 AM.png>)

### Parallel Routes Benefits 

A clear benefit of parallel routes is their ability to split a single layout into various slots, making the code more manageable

Independent route handling

Sub-navigation

```tsx
export default function DashboardLayout({
    children,
    users,
    revenue,
    notifications,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode;
    users: React.ReactNode;
    revenue: React.ReactNode;
    notifications: React.ReactNode;
}) {
    return (
        <>
            <div>{children}</div>
            <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
                <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
                    <div>{users}</div>
                    <div>{revenue}</div>
                </div>
                <div style={{ display: "flex", flex: 1 }}>{notifications}</div>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}

```

### Independent Route Handling 
Each slot of your layout, such as user analytics or revenue metrics, can have its own loading and error states 

This granular control is particularly beneficial in scenarios where different sections of the page load at varying speeds or encounter unique errors

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 11.08.13 AM.png>)

### Sub-navigation in routes 

Each slot of your dashboard can essentially function as a mini-application,
complete with its own navigation and state management 

This is especially useful in a complex application such as our dashboard where different sections serve distinct purposes.

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 11.09.57 AM.png>)


### Unmatched Routes
<b><u>Navigation from the Ul</u></b>

In the case of navigation within the Ul, Next. js retains the previously active state of a slot regardless of changes in the URL.

<b><u>Page reload</u></b>


Next.js immediately searches for a default.ts file within each unmatched slot. 

The presence of this file is critical, as it provides the default content that Next.js will render in the user interface

If this default.ts file is missing in any of the unmatched slots for the current route, Next.js will render a 404 error.


### default.tsx 


The ```default.tsx``` file in Next.js serves as a fallback to render content when the framework cannot retrieve a slot's active state from the current URL 
You have complete freedom to define the Ul for unmatched routes: you can either mirror the content found in page.ts or craft an entirely custom view
